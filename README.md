# ⚡ FLUX: Where Shopping Flows

Developed a mobile app with a user-friendly e-commerce product listing page using React Native. 
The app allow users to browse through products, apply filters (e.g., category, price range), 
sort products based on different criteria, and support pagination for smooth navigation through the 
product catalog.

Built with React Native and TypeScript, this project demonstrates how modern mobile architecture can create experiences that feel almost magical in their responsiveness. Every animation is buttery smooth, every search result appears instantly, and every interaction feels natural.

## The Tech Stack

- **React Native** - **TypeScript**  - **Zustand** - **Tailwind CSS** (via nativewind) - **Lucide Icons**


## Project Structure
The app follows a clean, hierarchical structure:
Everything has its place:

```
